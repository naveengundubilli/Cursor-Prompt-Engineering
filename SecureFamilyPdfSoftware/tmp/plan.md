# Secure Family PDF Software - Implementation Plan

## Current State
- Empty workspace with only a text file
- Need to build a complete Windows PDF application from scratch
- Must be offline-first, secure, and Windows-native

## Final State
- .NET 8 WPF desktop application with MSIX packaging
- Secure PDF rendering with sandboxing and JavaScript disabled
- True redaction capabilities and optional password protection
- Adobe-style UI with thumbnails, zoom controls, and keyboard shortcuts
- Comprehensive testing and documentation

## Files to Change
1. Create project structure with .NET 8 WPF solution
2. Implement core PDF rendering engine with security controls
3. Build main application UI with Adobe-style layout
4. Add redaction and password protection features
5. Create MSIX packaging and deployment scripts
6. Implement comprehensive testing suite
7. Add documentation and build automation
