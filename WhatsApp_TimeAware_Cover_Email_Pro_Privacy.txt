Subject: Feature request — Time‑aware & Quiet‑Hours Messaging (privacy‑first, lightweight)

Hi WhatsApp team,

I’m proposing a small, privacy‑first set of enhancements to reduce accidental off‑hours pings and improve cross‑timezone messaging:

WHAT
• Optional local‑time chip below a contact’s name (recipient‑shared timezone).
• Recipient‑owned Quiet Hours; when inside that window, default the send action to “Deliver at 7:00 am their time,” with a one‑tap override.
• Optional “Urgent” toggle that only requests higher notification priority; OS Focus/DND and recipient rules still apply.

WHY IT HELPS
• Fewer late‑night interruptions → higher trust and satisfaction.
• Clear sender intent → fewer support complaints and less “message regret.”
• Lightweight and E2EE‑compatible: client adds a small not_before timestamp; servers already queue ciphertext (store‑and‑forward).

PRIVACY NOTE (for PM/Legal)
Privacy by design: the feature is strictly opt‑in and shares only a coarse timezone (IANA ID, e.g., “America/Chicago”) and an on/off indicator for Quiet Hours. No precise location, travel history, device DND/Focus state, or exact sleep schedule is ever exposed. The local‑time chip is computed on‑device from a cached timezone string, avoiding extra network calls. Messages remain end‑to‑end encrypted; scheduling adds only a minimal not_before timestamp as metadata. Data collection is minimized to timezone, a boolean “has quiet hours,” and the scheduled UTC send time.

Residual‑risk mitigations: to avoid pattern‑of‑life leakage, scheduled sends can include a small random jitter (±5–10 minutes), and the exact Quiet Hours window is never revealed to senders—only the computed delivery time. Timezone changes default to user‑confirmed updates and are not broadcast. While the server must see the intended send time via not_before, this is less sensitive than content and comparable to existing delivery timestamps; we recommend documenting this in the privacy notice and including clear delete/export controls.

I’ve attached a concise brief and a UI mock. Happy to clarify or iterate with PM/Eng.

Thanks for considering,
Naveen G.
