# Microservices Bootcamp – Modular Architecture & Onboarding Framework

---

## 🧭 Overview

This bootcamp scaffolds a **secure, scalable, and reproducible microservices architecture** using Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and DevOps best practices. It is divided into 8 modular phases, each with Cursor-ready prompt packs and onboarding guides. The goal is to empower teams with a production-grade system that is easy to maintain, extend, and teach.

---

## 🧱 Why This Approach?

We chose a **phased, prompt-driven structure** to ensure:
- 🔁 **Reproducibility** across environments and teams
- 🧑‍🏫 **Beginner-friendly onboarding** with clear documentation
- 🔐 **Security and observability** baked in from the start
- 🚀 **CI/CD automation** for fast, safe deployments
- 📊 **Monitoring and cost control** for long-term sustainability
- 🤝 **Knowledge transfer** for team growth and independence

Each phase builds on the previous, with clear boundaries and acceptance criteria.

## 📦 Phase Breakdown

### ✅ Phase 1: Project Scaffolding
- Modular services: `user-service`, `order-service`, `payment-service`
- API Gateway, Config Server, Eureka
- Maven structure with reproducible builds

### 🔐 Phase 2: Security and Auth
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure endpoints and token validation

### 🔄 Phase 3: Service Communication
- REST + Feign clients
- Eureka service discovery
- Retry, timeout, and fallback strategies

### 🧪 Phase 4: Testing and Quality
- Unit, integration, and contract tests
- Testcontainers and mock servers
- Coverage enforcement and CI integration

### 🛡️ Phase 5: Production Hardening
- Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
- Circuit breakers, rate limiting
- Secrets management and TLS

### ⚙️ Phase 6: CI/CD Pipelines
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Docker build/push automation
- Staging and production deploys
- Rollback and canary strategies

### 📈 Phase 7: Monitoring and Scaling
- Advanced Grafana dashboards
- Log aggregation (ELK or Loki)
- Autoscaling and resource quotas
- Cost optimization and billing alerts

### 📚 Phase 8: Documentation and Onboarding
- Architecture overview and service READMEs
- Dev setup and onboarding guides
- API docs and prompt packs
- Interview prep and knowledge transfer

## 🧠 Key Considerations

### 🔐 Security
- Never hardcode secrets; use Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
- Enforce HTTPS and mutual TLS for internal calls
- Scan Docker images and code for vulnerabilities

### 🧪 Testing
- Maintain >80% test coverage
- Include health checks and smoke tests in CI
- Use test data isolation and cleanup strategies

### 📊 Observability
- Use structured logging with trace IDs
- Monitor error rates, latency, and JVM metrics
- Alert on anomalies and failures

### 🚀 CI/CD
- Require PR reviews and branch protection
- Use versioned Docker tags and rollback plans
- Log deployment metadata and notify teams

### 📚 Documentation
- Keep READMEs updated per service
- Link diagrams, API specs, and onboarding guides
- Use prompt packs for reproducible AI workflows

## 🧩 Extensibility

This framework supports:
- Adding new services with copy-paste scaffolds
- Teaching via prompt packs and interview guides
- Migrating to Kubernetes, ArgoCD, or service mesh
- Open-sourcing with community enablement (Phase 9)

## 🏁 Next Steps

- ✅ Finalize Phase 8 onboarding materials
- 📦 Optional: Proceed to Phase 9 – Open Source Readiness
- 🖨️ Generate printable checklists for onboarding and CI/CD
- 🧠 Share prompt packs with mentees or contributors
